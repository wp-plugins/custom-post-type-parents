Set a "parent page" for custom post types that is indicated in menus, lists of pages, and the Simple Section Navigation widget.

== Description ==

**Like this plugin? Please consider (leaving a 5-star review)[https://wordpress.org/support/view/plugin-reviews/custom-post-type-parents].**

This plugin is meant to solve the problem of highlighting "parent" pages for Custom Post Types in the menu and lists of pages. It integrates with custom menu output as well as output for any functions like `wp_list_pages()` that utilize the `page_css_class` or `nav_menu_css_class` filters. When viewing a custom post type, the assigned "parent page" will be indicated with standard WordPress classes (e.g. current_page_item) in navigation menus and lists of pages.

= Usage =
1. In the admin, navigate to **Settings > Custom Post Type Parents**
2. For each custom post type, use the dropdown to select a "parent page"

Menus and lists of pages will now have the appropriate classes applied to the specified parent pages. Additionally, Custom Post Type Parents will apply these classes to [Simple Section Navigation](https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-section-navigation/) widgets, if the plugin is installed.

= Classes =
Custom Post Type Parents applies the following classes to parent and ancestor pages (all classes are consistent with default WordPress classes and are backwards compatible).

**Parent**    
* current-menu-parent
* current_page_parent
* current-custom-post-type-parent
* current-{post type}-parent

**Ancestor**    
* current-menu-ancestor
* current_page_ancestor
* current-custom-post-type-ancestor
* current-{post type}-ancestor
